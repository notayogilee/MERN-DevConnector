# MERN-DevConnector
This is a MERN stack application from the "MERN Stack Front To Back" course by Brad Traversy on Udemy.  
It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

## Deployed app
The app has been deployed to https://lee-dev-connector.herokuapp.com
It is deployed on free tier on Heroku and MongoDB so I may need to clear the database once in a while.

}
```
